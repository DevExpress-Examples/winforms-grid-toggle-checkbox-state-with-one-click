# How to change an in-place checkbox state by single click when multi-selection is enabled


<p><br />
<p>This example combines solutions that are illustrated in the following articles:</p><p><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E315">How to force the CheckEdit to change its state only when clicked in the glyph</a></p><p><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/K18380">Why are several clicks necessary to change an in-place CheckEdit's state when multiple cell selection is enabled?</a></p><br />
<p>In this example an end-user can select multiple cells in a usual manner by pressing the left mouse button and moving the mouse. If the click was performed exactly in the CheckEdit's glyph, a CheckEdit's state will be changed. Thus, an end-user can change the checkbox' state using only one click, but at the same time it is possible to start multi-selection from the check box.</p></p>
